<a id="what-it-does"></a>
<a id="requirements"></a>

## What you need

- An Apple silicon Mac on macOS 15 or later; 16 GB memory recommended.
- About 3 GB of disk space per model.
- A comma 3X or comma 4, powered separately.
- A USB 3 USB-C data cable.

## 1. Install Jetlink

Set up offroad. Keep the comma and Mac online, and the Mac powered and awake.

1. Download the Mac DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/zoompilot/jetlink/releases).
2. Drag **Jetlink** to **Applications** and open it.
3. Wait for **Waiting for comma**. Leave the settings at their defaults.

## 2. Connect the comma

1. **Install zoompilot.** After resetting the comma, enter
   **`zoompilot/develop`** as the install URL. Already on zoompilot? Select
   **develop** in **Settings > Software > Target Branch > Non-Prebuilt Branches**.
   Wait for installation, rebooting, and building to finish.
2. Set **Settings > Models > Accelerator Link** to **USB**.
   Leave **Big Model** at its default.
3. Connect the Mac to the comma with the USB cable.

Stay offroad and online until the comma's home-button icon turns **green**.
It pulses while the model downloads and prepares.

In Jetlink, check for **Connected over USB 3**, a rate near **20 frames per
second**, and **zero slow frames**. If it says USB 2, check the cable and port.
Read [daily use](using-jetlink.md) before driving.

To download a model ahead of time, see [Models](models.md#prepare-ahead-of-time-optional).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | First step |
| --- | --- |
| Server failed to start | Open **Logs**. Check that another Jetlink server is not running and the cache folder is writable. |
| Model takes minutes to load | Close large apps. In **Models**, right-click the model, choose **Delete Prepared Engines…**, then use it again. On an M1 Pro, preparing takes about 20 seconds and loading up to 10. |
| Link drops when the Mac sleeps | Enable **Prevent sleep while server is running** and keep it on power, or also enable **Prevent sleep with the lid closed**. |
| Slow frames | Check the cable and port, then close other apps using the GPU or Neural Engine. |
| Network settings show a **jetlink** service | Set the comma's **Accelerator Link** to **USB**. |

## Settings

| Setting | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Open Jetlink at login | Start the app automatically. |
| Prevent sleep while server is running | Prevent idle sleep on power. On battery, keep the lid open. |
| Prevent sleep with the lid closed | Also on battery, with the lid open or closed. Normal sleep returns when the server stops. |
| Cache folder | Choose where models are stored. Restart the server to apply. |
| Connection | Keep **USB** for driving. **TCP** is for testing. |

Keep **Backend** on **Automatic**. If another app keeps the Neural Engine busy,
try **CoreML (GPU)**. Click **Restart Server** after changing settings.

**Benchmark** (Command-3) tests the loaded model without a comma connected.

<summary>Files and uninstalling</summary>

## Where things live

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Models | `~/Library/Application Support/Jetlink/cache`, or your chosen cache folder |
| Log | `~/Library/Logs/Jetlink/server.log` |
| App | `/Applications/Jetlink.app` |

To uninstall, quit Jetlink and delete the app, `~/Library/Application Support/Jetlink`,
and `~/Library/Logs/Jetlink`. This deletes downloaded models. If you enabled
**Open Jetlink at login**, remove it in **System Settings > General > Login Items**.
