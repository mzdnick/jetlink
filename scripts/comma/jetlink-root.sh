#   sudo scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh gadget            # the gadget for a Jetson or a Mac
#   sudo scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh gadget --ios      # the gadget for an iPhone
#   sudo scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh gadget --ncm      # the same composite, for any host
#                                                          that wants the cable network too
#   sudo scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh net               # after a bind, composite only: address, DHCP
#   sudo scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh check             # what is there now
#   sudo scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh teardown
#   sudo scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh port hold|off     # the USB-C port held as the device, or let go

#
# For the comma four and the comma 3X only. Both are SDM845 on the same AGNOS
# kernel (4.9, dwc3 at a600000.dwc3), with configfs, FunctionFS and NCM built
# in and no modules to load.
# The 3X is assumed from the kernel it shares with the four; only the four has been on the bench.
#
# gadget: the USB gadget, chosen by the comma's Accelerator Link setting. The
# comma is the USB device and the host runs the model; docs/transport.md says
# why. For a Jetson or a Mac (USB), the FunctionFS vendor interface alone. For
# an iPhone (iOS, with --ios), a composite: the vendor interface first, so it
# stays interface 0, and a CDC-NCM network interface after it, since an iPhone
# app can only use the network: the phone gets 192.168.60.x by DHCP from the
# dnsmasq this script starts on the gadget's netdev, and dials the comma at
# 192.168.60.1:5599. --ncm builds the same composite for any host that wants
# the cable network alongside the vendor link: a Mac benching over TCP, or ssh
# to the comma without Wi-Fi. The host keeps both interfaces; the vendor
# interface stays interface 0 either way.
#
# It does not bind the UDC: a FunctionFS gadget cannot attach to a controller
# until its descriptors are written, and the owner, which opens ep0, writes
# them and binds. The NCM function rides on that bind, and its netdev exists
# only from the first bind on, so the network is set up by net, which the owner
# runs after each bind.
#
# On failure the reason is left in $STATUS_FILE as well as on stderr, so the
# openpilot side can say why the link is unavailable. net reports in
# $NET_STATUS_FILE; it never fails the gadget.
